  Relentlessly interviews the user about a plan or design (grilling), sharpening

  writes a spec file to the *target* repo's `.agents/plans/<topic>.spec.md` as

  Use when the user asks to "grill me into a spec", "grill this plan",
  "stress-test this design and write a spec", or wants a spec-driven starting

# Grill to Spec

Interview the user relentlessly about a plan or design until shared
understanding is reached, then capture that understanding as a **spec** the
user can plan and implement from. This is the grilling loop plus active domain
modeling, with two deliverables at the end: a spec file, and (with permission)
manifest updates.

## Inputs you must resolve first

- **Template repo (source):** the folder that contains this skill. Never write
the spec or manifest edits here. Also, the skill may be called from a different place. In that case, ignore the template repo and work with the target repo directly.
- **Target repo (destination):** the repo the plan is about. The spec and any manifest updates go there.

If the workspace has one directory, it is the target. If the workspace has exactly two folders, the one that is **not** this template
is the target. If it is ambiguous, ask the user before writing anything.

> **Safety:** All writes (spec, manifest edits) go to the **target** repo only.



## Phase 1: Grilling

Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of the plan until you reach
a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving
dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your
recommended answer.

Ask the questions **one at a time**, waiting for feedback on each question
before continuing. 

If a *fact* can be found by exploring the target repo, look it up rather than
asking. The *decisions*, though, are the user's — put each one to them and wait
for their answer.

Do not write the spec, and do not enact the plan, until the user confirms you
have reached a shared understanding. Do not implement any of the decisions until the spec is written. Even then, recommend the user to plan and implement the spec in a separate chat.

## Phase 2: Domain modeling during the session

While grilling, actively sharpen the target repo's domain model. The canonical
glossary in a manifest repo is `.agents/rules/terms.rule.md`; decisions live in
`.agents/adr/*.adr.md`.

- **Challenge against the terms.** If the target has a `terms.rule.md` and
the user uses a term that conflicts with it, call it out: example: "Your
terms file defines 'adoption' as X, but you seem to mean Y — which is your intent?"
- **Sharpen fuzzy language.** When the user uses vague or overloaded terms,
propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'target' — do you mean the
product or the build option?"
- **Discuss concrete scenarios.** Stress-test domain relationships with
specific edge-case scenarios that force precision about boundaries between
concepts.
- **Cross-reference with code.** When the user states how something works,
check whether the target repo's code agrees. Surface contradictions.

Do **not** edit manifest files during this phase. Instead, keep a running list
of manifest files that the session's decisions make stale (see Phase 4).

## Phase 3: Write the spec

When the user confirms shared understanding is reached — or asks to wrap up —
write the spec to the **target repo** at:

```
.agents/plans/<topic>.spec.md
```

Use a short, descriptive dash-case `<topic>` (e.g. `partial-refunds.spec.md`).
Create `.agents/plans/` if it does not exist. Never place the spec anywhere
else, and never in the template repo.

The spec is the starting point of the user's task: complete enough to plan and
implement from without re-deriving the conversation. Structure:

```markdown
# <Title> Spec

> Produced by a grilling session on YYYY-MM-DD. Status: ready for planning.

## Goal
What is being built or changed, and why. One or two paragraphs.

## Decisions
The resolved design decisions from the session, each with its rationale.
This is the heart of the spec — one entry per branch of the design tree.

## Scope
What is in scope, and — just as important — what was explicitly ruled out.

## Details
Details of the task intended spec.

## Constraints
Mandates, invariants, and hard limits the implementation must respect; only those that are relevant to the spec, but absent in the ADRs and rules.

## Open questions
Anything deliberately deferred, with who/what resolves it.

```

Omit sections that would be empty; add sections the topic demands. Link to the
target's manifest documents (ADRs, references, rules) instead of duplicating
their content.

If the session ends **without** reaching shared understanding, do not write a
spec. Tell the user which branches remain unresolved.

## Phase 4: Offer manifest updates (permission-gated)

After the spec is written, check whether the session's decisions made any manifest files in the target repo stale. Follow the placement rules in target repo's manifest structure (.agents/rules/manifest-structure.rule.md if present)


Candidates to check (only if the file/directory already exists in the target):

- `.agents/rules/terms.rule.md` — terms coined or sharpened during the session.
- `.agents/adr/` — a decision from the session that is hard to reverse,
surprising without context, and the result of a real trade-off. If any of the
three is missing, skip the ADR.
- `.agents/reference/` — mechanics described in the session that contradict or
extend an existing `*.ref.md`.
- `.agents/guides/` — procedures or commands the session changed.

Then:

1. **List** the files that need an update and what would change in each, in one
  short summary.
2. **Ask the user's permission** before editing any of them.
3. Update **only** the files the user approves, following the target's naming
  suffixes (`*.adr.md`, `*.ref.md`, `<category>.rule.md`) and cross-linking
   conventions.

## Decision tree

```
Workspace folders?
├─ Only this template open ......... STOP: ask user to add their repo
├─ Exactly two ..................... target = the other folder
└─ Ambiguous ....................... ASK which folder is the target

Shared understanding confirmed?
├─ No .............................. keep grilling; no spec, no edits
└─ Yes ............................. write .agents/plans/<topic>.spec.md

Stale manifest files found in target?
├─ No .............................. report "manifest untouched" and stop
└─ Yes ............................. list them → ask permission → update
                                     only the approved ones
```



## Completion checks

- Questions were asked one at a time; facts came from the repo, decisions from
the user.
- The spec exists at `<target>/.agents/plans/<topic>.spec.md` and is complete
enough to plan from — or the user was told why no spec was written.
- No manifest file was edited without the user's explicit approval.
- Nothing was written into the template repo.
